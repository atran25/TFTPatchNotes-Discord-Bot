**About**  
Discord bot that scrapes the Teamfight Tactics website and returns information about the latest Patchnotes. It can either return the patch highlight picture or it can take input from a user and scrape the entire patch note for any changes related to the input.  
  
**Note**  
Feel free to use the bot for your own server. Just make sure to use your own GuildId, clientId, and token.
